# Prepare Release Skill

Automates the release preparation workflow: analyze changes since the last release, propose a version bump with release notes, and open a PR that feeds the tag-driven release pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- You must be on a clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
- `gh` CLI must be authenticated
- The repository must have at least one existing `v*` tag

## Phase 1: Gather Data

1. **Switch to main and pull latest:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Read current version** from `package.json` (the `"version"` field).

3. **Find the last tagged release:**
   ```bash
   git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1
   ```
   This is the baseline. All commits between this tag and `HEAD` are candidates.

4. **Collect commits since the last tag:**
   ```bash
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
   ```
   Also collect the full messages for classification:
   ```bash
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD --format='%H %s' --no-merges
   ```

## Phase 2: Classify Commits

For each commit, assign exactly one category using the rules below. Apply them in order — first match wins.

### Classification Rules

| Priority | Signal | Category |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Prefix `feat:` or `feat(...):`; or commit clearly introduces new user-visible functionality | **Feature** |
| 2 | Prefix `fix:` or `fix(...):`; or commit fixes a bug visible to end users | **Bug Fix** |
| 3 | Prefix `perf:` or `perf(...):`; or commit improves performance, forward-looking API changes, or internal optimizations that *could* affect UX but are invisible | **Internal** |
| 4 | Prefix `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `build:`, `refactor:`; or commit is infrastructure, test coverage, devops, tooling | **Non-User** |
| 5 | Ambiguous commits — read the full message and diff summary to decide. When in doubt, classify as **Internal**. | — |

### Special handling
- **Version bump commits** (e.g., `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`) — skip entirely, these are release mechanics.
- **Merge commits** are already excluded by `--no-merges`.

## Phase 3: Coalesce

Reduce the classified list by merging related entries:

1. **Feature absorbs its fixes:** If a feature was added and subsequent commits fix bugs *in that same feature*, collapse them into the single feature row. The feature description should reflect the final working state.
2. **Multiple fixes in one area → one row:** If several bug fixes target the same component or behavior, combine into a single descriptive bug fix row.
3. **Keep distinct items separate:** Don't over-merge. Two unrelated bug fixes stay as two rows.

After coalescing, you should have a clean list with categories: **Feature**, **Bug Fix**, **Internal**. **Non-User** items are dropped entirely.

## Phase 4: Propose Release

Present the following to the user:

### Recommended Version

- If the classified list contains at least one **Feature** → **minor** version bump (e.g., `0.26.0` → `0.27.0`)
- If no features, only bug fixes and/or internals → **patch** version bump (e.g., `0.26.0` → `0.26.1`)
- **Never** propose a major version bump

### Release Title

A brief phrase (not a full sentence, no period) capturing the marquee theme. Guidelines:
- If there is a standout feature, name it: `"New KanBoss Plugin"`
- If multiple features, generalize: `"Plugin System & Agent Improvements"`
- If only fixes/internals: `"Bug Fixes & Performance Improvements"`
- If nothing meaningful: `"Various Bug Fixes & Improvements"`

### Release Notes Table

Present a markdown table:

```
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Feature | ... |
| Bug Fix | ... |
| Internal | ... |
```

- **Non-User** items are excluded from this table.
- **Internal** items are included in the table but excluded from the release title.
- If a category is empty, omit its rows entirely.
- Descriptions should be user-friendly, concise, and written in past tense (e.g., "Added model selector to agent settings", "Fixed plugin permission popups clipping under panels").

### Raw Commit List

Below the table, show the full raw commit list (one-liners) with their classifications for transparency, so the user can verify the coalescing was reasonable.

### Ask for Feedback

Use `AskUserQuestion` or direct prompting to ask the user:
- Is the version correct?
- Is the release title good?
- Any edits to the release notes table?
- Ready to proceed?

Iterate until the user confirms. Do not proceed to Phase 5 until explicit confirmation.

## Phase 5: Create Version Bump PR

Once the user confirms:

1. **Create branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/<new-version> main
   ```

2. **Update version in `package.json`:**
   Change the `"version"` field to the new version. Only `package.json` needs updating.

3. **Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to <new-version>"
   ```

4. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin release/<new-version>
   ```

5. **Open PR** using `gh pr create`. The PR format is critical — the release pipeline extracts release notes from the PR body.

   - **Title:** `chore: bump version to <new-version>`
   - **Body:** Markdown with the following structure. The first line **must** be the `Release:` title — the release pipeline parses this to populate the update banner. Skip any section that has no items. Do not include a section header if its list would be empty.

   ```markdown
   Release: <Release Title>

   # New Features
   - Description A from the confirmed table
   - Description B from the confirmed table

   # Bug Fixes
   - Description C from the confirmed table

   # Improvements
   - Description D from the confirmed table
   ```

   Section mapping:
   - **Feature** rows → `# New Features`
   - **Bug Fix** rows → `# Bug Fixes`
   - **Internal** rows → `# Improvements`

   Use a HEREDOC to pass the body:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "chore: bump version to <new-version>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Release: <Release Title>

   ...body content...
   EOF
   )"
   ```

## Phase 6: Provide Tag Command

After the PR is created, provide the user with a single copy-pasteable command block:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull origin main && git tag -s v<new-version> -m "<Release Title>" && git push origin v<new-version>
```

Where:
- `<new-version>` is the confirmed version (e.g., `0.27.0`)
- `<Release Title>` is the confirmed release title (e.g., `New KanBoss Plugin`)

**Clearly instruct the user:** "Run this command only after the PR is merged to main."

Then return to your standby branch:
```bash
git checkout <agent-name>/standby
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Never tag or push tags yourself** — only the user does this after PR merge.
2. **Never propose a major version bump.**
3. **Non-User changes never appear in the release title, release notes table, or PR body.**
4. **Internal changes appear in the table and PR body (as "Improvements") but not in the release title.**
5. **The PR body format is load-bearing** — the release pipeline parses `Release: <title>` from the first line and the section content as release notes. Do not add extra markdown, emoji, test plans, or co-authored-by lines to the PR body.
6. **Version bump commits from previous releases must be skipped** during classification.
7. **Iterate with the user** — do not open the PR until the user explicitly confirms the version, title, and notes.
